# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the total worth of a customer to a business throughout the duration of their relationship. 
It measures the revenue generated by the customer for the company, which can differ from one customer-business pair to another. 
CLV is a useful metric for evaluating the profitability of customer relationships and comparing it against the cost of acquiring new customers. 
It predicts future profitability, in contrast to customer profitability (CP), which evaluates past profitability. 
CLV is crucial for answering important questions about sales, such as identifying the most profitable customers, segmenting them, and 
allocating budgets for customer acquisition. 
The lifetime of a customer-business relationship, on which CLV is based, can vary depending on the product or service offered by the company.
